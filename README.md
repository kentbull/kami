# KAMI - KERI AsyncIO Muggle Implementation
KAMI aims to be a a spec-compliant KERI & ACDC implementation using Python's AsyncIO rather than HIO.

This includes everything in the the KERIpy, KERIA, and SignifyPy implementations all in one with the exception of the HIO dependency.

It is mostly a copy and paste of the aforementioned dependencies with major modifications to make it work with AsyncIO.

For ease of translating the package structures exactly mirror KERIpy, KERIA, and SignifyPy.
